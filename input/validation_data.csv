"@united I need to get from Albuquerque, NM, USA, to Cebu, Philippines. I'm providing educational help for 800 kids. Can you help me?",0
@USAirways strikes again--Late Flight crew #3/4 for the trip and maintenance #2/4.  Worth the extra $200/trip for less hassle and fewer delays,-1
.@united This flight attendant was extremely helpful to a woman who had a hard time walking. Very touching!,1
@AmericanAir  your customer service is deplorable. I am disgusted in your company and the ignorant people on the phones for lost baggage.,-1
@SouthwestAir telling my Fam in Vegas now. :),1
"@usairways trick for getting into your hold queue?  I've been calling since Thursday and keep getting the ""call back Late Flightr"" message",-1
